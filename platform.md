1. A online platform for students to appear for examinations in online mode while the education sector was hit with the pandemic.
This platform enabled students to continue their education by appearing for examinations through my portal which was then used by teachers to examine and track the students progress.
The platform was built using Html,Css,Js in about 4 months and it was used by 500 students.


2. Built a project inspired by Wifi service product and OTT platform like Airtel XStream and JIO fiber. 
This enabled the consumers to connect to the wireless network using their handheld devices
